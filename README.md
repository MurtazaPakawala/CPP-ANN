# Neural Network Implementation in C++

## Overview

This project is a scratch implementation of a neural network in C++. I built this project to deepen my understanding of neural networks and their underlying mechanics specifically the gradient and implementation of it. During my learning process, I found Dave Miller's work on neural networks incredibly helpful. You can check out his blog post [here](<insert-blog-url>).

## How to Run the Program

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Clean the build (optional):**
   ```bash
   make clean
   ```

3. **Compile the program using the Makefile:**
   ```bash
   make
   ```

4. **Run the program:**
   ```bash
   ./main
   ```

## Class Diagram

The class structure of the neural network is represented by the following diagram:

This diagram provides a high-level overview of the main classes and their relationships in the neural network implementation.
